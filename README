Important:
There is a new category for our buddys.
The holy category means buddys where is sure that the buddy is a friend.
Only from these Buddys you can receive files and not block wherever he do.
Normal buddys more control in the future to defeat a ddos.
When you have write with on buddy you can set he in the holy group and transfer data but 
when you know that somebody is a ddos or a spamer you can transfer him in the blacklist.
In the blacklist there is no connection between your and the other, 
the other can try to send a message but you ignore that.
I hope that we can in the future increase the security versus ddos.

before I forget, welcome to github :)
